Game Explanation: "The Chicken, Fox, and Grains"

In this classic logic puzzle, your objective is to transport a chicken, a fox, and a bag of grains across a river using a boat. However, you can only take one item at a time. The challenge lies in ensuring that certain combinations are not left alone together:

Fox + Chicken: If left alone, the fox will eat the chicken. Chicken + Grains: If left alone, the chicken will eat the grains. Steps to Play:

Start with all three items on one side of the river. Decide which item to take across first. After transporting one item, return alone to the original side. Continue transporting the remaining items, always ensuring that you donâ€™t leave the fox alone with the chicken or the chicken alone with the grains. Goal: Successfully transport all three items to the other side without any unfortunate incidents.

Good luck!
